///You are given a polynomial  of a single indeterminate (or variable), .
You are also given the values of  and . Your task is to verify if .

Constraints
All coefficients of polynomial  are integers.
 and  are also integers.///



code:
s = input() # read input
# s = "1 4";
f = input()
# f = "x^3 + x^2 + x + 1"
(x,y) = s.split() # args
x=int(x)
y=int(y)
# print (x, y)
z=eval(f)
if (z == y):
    print ("True")
else:
    print ("False")


output:
Input (stdin)
1 4
x**3 + x**2 + x + 1
Your Output (stdout)
True
Expected Output
True
