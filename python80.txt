///In this challenge, the task is to debug the existing code to successfully execute all provided test files.

Consider that vowels in the alphabet are a, e, i, o, u and y.

Function score_words takes a list of lowercase words as an argument and returns a score as follows:

The score of a single word is  if the word contains an even number of vowels. Otherwise, the score of this word is . 
The score for the whole list of words is the sum of scores of all words in the list.

Debug the given function score_words such that it returns a correct score.

Your function will be tested on several cases by the locked template code///
