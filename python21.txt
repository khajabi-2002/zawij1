///You are given a two lists  and . Your task is to compute their cartesian product X.

Example

A = [1, 2]
B = [3, 4]

AxB = [(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)]
Note:  and  are sorted lists, and the cartesian product's tuples should be output in sorted order.///


code:
# itertools.product() in Python - Hacker Rank Solution
# Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT
# itertools.product() in Python - Hacker Rank Solution START
from itertools import product
A = input().split()
A = list(map(int,A))
B = input().split()
B = list(map(int, B))

result:
Input (stdin)
1 2
3 4
Your Output (stdout)
(1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 4) 
Expected Output
(1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 4)
