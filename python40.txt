///There is an array of  integers. There are also  disjoint sets,  and , each containing  integers. 
You like all the integers in set  and dislike all the integers in set . Your initial happiness is . 
For each  integer in the array, if , you add  to your happiness. If , you add  to your happiness.

Note: Since  and  are sets, they have no repeated elements.
 However, the array might contain duplicate elements.
